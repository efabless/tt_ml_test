There are a ton of notebooks out there that teach you the fundamentals of deep learning and PyTorch, so here the idea is to give you some basic introduction to deep learning and PyTorch at a very high level. Therefore, this notebook is targeting beginners but it can also serve as a review for more experienced developers.\n",
